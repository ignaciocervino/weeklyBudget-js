# Weekly Budget
In this app I use object oriented programming to keep track of a  weekly budget program.
The user enters the weekly budget in dollars, the system validates its a valid value.
Then he will get a interface with the actuall budget and the remaining one. 
He can enter his daily expenses and those one will be subtracted from the budget and also listed on top.
The user is able to remove expenses. He will see color advises when the budget is 50% and 75% smaller.
